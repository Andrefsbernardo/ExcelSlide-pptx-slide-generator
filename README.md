# ExcelSlide — PowerPoint Slide Generator from Excel Data

This project automates the creation of multiple PowerPoint slides using Python, **pandas**, and **python-pptx**. It pulls structured data from an Excel file and injects it into a predefined PowerPoint template, generating a batch of slides automatically.

Originally built to streamline **donor insights reporting**, this solution is **template-agnostic** — it can be easily adapted for any context requiring bulk slide generation from spreadsheet data.
